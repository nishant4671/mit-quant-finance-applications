📅 Daily Bot

**Daily Bot** is an automated GitHub bot that tracks daily activity and commits it to your repository. Powered by GitHub Actions, it runs on a scheduled basis, appends a timestamp or log entry to a central activity file, and automatically pushes the update – ensuring you maintain a consistent, auditable record of your progress or system status.

## ✨ Features

- **Scheduled Automation**: Runs on a cron schedule (e.g., daily at midnight) via GitHub Actions.
- **Activity Logging**: Appends a timestamped entry to `daily-activity.log` – ideal for tracking tasks, availability, or metrics.
- **Auto-Commit & Push**: Automatically commits and pushes changes to the repository, keeping your history up-to-date without manual intervention.
- **Lightweight & Simple**: Minimal setup; just clone, configure, and let the bot handle the rest.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- A GitHub repository where you have write access.
- Basic familiarity with GitHub Actions and YAML syntax (optional, but helpful).

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository** (if you haven't already):
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/daily-bot.git
   cd daily-bot
   ```

2. **Ensure the log file exists**:
   Create an initial `daily-activity.log` file in the root directory (or let the workflow create it).

3. **Set up the GitHub Actions workflow**:
   The `.github/workflows/auto-commit.yml` file should already be present. If not, create it with the configuration below.

### Configuration

The workflow is driven by the YAML file in `.github/workflows/`. Here's a sample configuration that runs daily at 00:00 UTC:

```yaml
name: Daily Sync

on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 0 * * *'  # Runs every day at midnight UTC
  workflow_dispatch:      # Allows manual trigger

jobs:
  update-log:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Append activity log
        run: |
          echo "$(date) - Daily sync executed" >> daily-activity.log

      - name: Commit and push changes
        run: |
          git config --global user.name "github-actions[bot]"
          git config --global user.email "github-actions[bot]@users.noreply.github.com"
          git add daily-activity.log
          git commit -m "Daily sync #$(date +'%Y%m%d')" || echo "No changes to commit"
          git push
```

**Customization**:
- Change the cron expression to suit your schedule (e.g., `'0 12 * * 1-5'` for weekdays at noon).
- Replace the `echo` command with any script (Python, Bash) that generates more detailed logs.

## 📂 Project Structure

```
daily-bot/
├── .github/
│   └── workflows/
│       └── auto-commit.yml   # GitHub Actions workflow definition
├── daily-activity.log        # The log file updated by the bot
└── README.md                 # This file
```

## 🖥 Usage

Once the workflow is committed and pushed, GitHub Actions will automatically run according to the schedule. You can also trigger it manually from the **Actions** tab in your repository by selecting the workflow and clicking **"Run workflow"**.

After each run, check `daily-activity.log` – you'll see a new entry appended. The commit history will show the updates.

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

- **Workflow fails with push errors**: Ensure the `GITHUB_TOKEN` has write permissions. By default, it does, but if you've restricted it, adjust the workflow's `permissions` section.
- **No changes committed**: If the log file hasn't changed, the commit step will exit gracefully with `"No changes to commit"`.
